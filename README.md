# Simple Socket Communication Program

## Overview

This is a simple socket communication program developed in C# using console applications. The program facilitates synchronous communication with a persistent connection, utilising stream sockets and the TCP protocol. The server application listens on a specific IP address and port. The client application connects to the server's IP address and port.
## Features

- **Communication Type:** Synchronous
- **Connection Type:** Persistent
- **Socket Type:** Stream
- **Protocol:** TCP
## Usage

**Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/dnkFrvgv/SocketSyncChat.git
```

**Build the Solution:** Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment and build the project.

**Run the Server:** Execute the server application to start listening for incoming connections.

**Run the Client:** Execute the client application to connect to the server.

**Communication:** Once the client is connected, you can send and receive messages between the client and server. The connection is persistent until explicitly closed by the client.
